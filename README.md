# Spring2022_Econ613_Assignments
Please find the complated assignments in the assignment folder.

There should be a PDF named "AssignmentX.pdf" where X is the Number associated with the assignment

There should also be an R fail name "AX.R" where X is the Number associated with the assignment

There should be a PDF name "ReadingNotesX.pdf", where X is the indexing of the reading note.

For Reading Note 1, I replaced the old reading note with the revised one. So it bears the name ReadingNote1.pdf

Thank you TAs!
